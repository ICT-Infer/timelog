# tl (timelog)

Time logging and reporting using stacks and stuff :D

## Description

`tl` is a command-line utility for logging time and generating reports.

`tl` supports a set of seven commands; `tl init`, `tl push-point`,
`tl cheat-dump-stack`, `tl pop-drop-point`, `tl pop-twice-merge-points-log`,
`tl unlog-split-push-points` and `tl show-report`. Those are the descriptive
names. Shorter aliases might be a good idea. Your shell probably supports
aliasing commands. Right?

Please refer to the source code for details :)

## Supported platforms

`tl` is currently being developed on OpenBSD 5.4 i386.
